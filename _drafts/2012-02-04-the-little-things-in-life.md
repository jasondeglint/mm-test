I have a nice little story that made my night that I would like to share:

Last Friday night I went with a friend to a coffee shop in Cook Street Village, Victoria called the Moka House. It is the only coffee shop that is open until 11 pm in town, so it is one I go to on a regular basis.
Upon arriving the friendly baristas started talking to us about what we wanted to drink. I told them that I was interested in drinking tea since I stopped drinking coffee. They were curious so I told them more and that I heard it takes 40 days to change or make a new habit and that I was on day 27 out of 40.

There were quite impressed by all of this and one of the baristas told me that she has a bad habit of biting her nails all the time. So in response I told her: “The best time to do something is between tomorrow and yesterday.”

They were so moved by this saying that they decided that it was worthy for the chalkboard that contains quotes for all to read. I was also pretty thrilled about this idea. I mean, I've never been quoted on a chalkboard in a coffee shop before. :P

After writing the quote they asked me what my name was, and at first I gave them my real name, but then realized it would sound a lot better if I used my alias, Larso. Plus, Larso by itself sounds a lot better than my real name after a quote. :)

And the most amazing part of all this is that they erased a quote from J.R.R. Tolkien to write my quote. What more needs to be said...

So that's the story how Larso got quoted in a coffee shop. Nothing major or important, but I figure it's the little things that can make a difference.
