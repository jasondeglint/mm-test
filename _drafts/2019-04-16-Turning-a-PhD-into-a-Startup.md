A number of years ago I had vision of starting a company and I decided to use my PhD to accomplish this task.
I wanted to share three lessons I learned so far by simultaneously doing a PhD and starting a company.
I know I have many more lessons ahead of me, but these three capture my journey so far.

***

**Lesson 1: The most important thing, is to keep the most important thing, the most important thing.**

I struggle with being a perfectionist and needing everything planned before I execute on anything. However this is a logical fallacy since I will NEVER know everything and perfection is impossible to achieve! Waiting until I am certain about a given decision will often lead to inaction. This is commonly known as "paralysis by analysis". To overcome this I found that it helps to ask myself this question: What are the costs and benefits of adopting a strategy of making a decision before I have all the evidence vs. waiting until I have all the evidence?

Inaction often leads to missed opportunities because one keeps on waiting until they have the perfect plan or the conditions are just right before they execute. This is flawed thinking because one's environment is always changing. If someone takes a long time to make the perfect plan it's no longer perfect since the landscape of the situation has changed!

If you need some motivation that encapsulates these ideas, listen to the following music video by Jocko Willink and Akira the Don. If you've never heard music like this before, then welcome to meaningwave.

**Lesson 2: You can't succeed alone.**

Pride can often get in the way of asking for help. Or fear of being found out.

Although my name is attached to this award, I am in no able to take sole credit for this.
First off, I have the unwavering support of my two academic supervisors, Alexander Wong <link> and Chao Jin <link> who constantly encourage in my endevor to commercial our research.
I also have the support of Velocity as Blue Lion Labs is part of Velocity Science <link>

**Lesson 3: Expect nothing to work the first time... or the second time.**

Be willing to be wrong 10 times before you expect to get it right.

Better to start with something terrible, because then you have something to work off of to improve. A bad plan is better than no plan. And you can improve on a bad plan -- so it makes a great starting point.

So those are three lessons I've learned to date. I hope these will help you on your journey.

Are you thinking of turning your research into a startup? Do you think you might be onto something big? If so, I strongly encourage you to take action on that thought. Talk to someone who could help you. Talk to potential customers to see if your solution could help. You don't know until you try -- and really, what do you have to lose?
