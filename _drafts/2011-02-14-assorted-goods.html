<p>Hey everybody!&nbsp; I'm back... </p>
<p>As mentioned in an earlier blog every week I am trying to take a picture to fit a given theme.&nbsp; The link is here if your curious and want to know more:<br /><a href="http://www.digital-photography-school.com/53-weekly-themes-for-your-2011-project-365">http://www.digital-photography-school.com/53-weekly-themes-for-your-2011-project-365</a></p>
<p>So this past weeks theme was body parts.&nbsp; I decided that I wanted to photograph some toes.&nbsp; Hopefully this doesn't gross you out...</p>
<p>Here are my big toes. :)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resize_edit_img_00511.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>&nbsp;The toes of some anonymous person.&nbsp; Don't worry... I had permission from the individual.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resize_edit_img_0062.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The following pictures are of just random household objects.&nbsp; I was a bit bored Saturday afternoon and started exploring.&nbsp; I like the lighting in these pictures.</p>
<p>time is a limited resource.&nbsp; There never seems to be enough of it in one day...</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resize_edit_img_0106.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Candles on a shelf in the kitchen.&nbsp; Sorry my lack of a creative descriptions...</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resize_edit_img_0115.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Cupboard door left open.&nbsp; Do you see the name inside? </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resize_edit_img_0120.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Driving through Grand Valley, ON one morning.&nbsp; We didn't stop but I was able to take this picture of the windmills and the rising sun through the window.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resize_edit_img_0623.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Almost every day while I walk to work there sits a flock of pigeons on the power lines.&nbsp; Makes me think of the song from Marry Poppins... "feed the birds"</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resize_edit_img_0629.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>During photography club last week we split up into smaller groups to photograph hallways, tunnels, and pathways.&nbsp; I got a bit side tracked from the group and found this cool room.&nbsp; It felt like I shouldn't have been in there so I quickly took a bunch of picture and left. :)</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resize_edit_img_9876.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Also during photography club, while traveling from building to building, I would get distracted by whatever caught my eye.&nbsp; The lamp post with the vine-covered wall was awesome.&nbsp; It was so incredibly cold however so we quickly rushed back indoors.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resize_edit_img_9905.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Another cool picture of the same lamp post.&nbsp; The bikes appear to have been deserted and lost in the snow.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resize_edit_img_9907.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>So there was a bit of everything in the post.&nbsp; Some lovely toes, random household objects, and some sweet outdoor pictures.</p>
