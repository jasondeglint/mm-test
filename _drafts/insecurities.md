- Surrounding myself with people who are smarter than I am.
- Imposture syndrome.


Insecurities

I am in an academic environment and nearly everyday I am surrounded by people who are much more intelligent that I am. This per say is not a bad thing, but many days I am full of insecurities and almost embarrassed when I don't know something. And the loop begins: I pretend I know something I don't, and then after I try to conduct a quick search of the topic, only to be more confused and more full of anxiety.

Then the self-talk starts:  "Do I really belong here?" or "What happens if they find out how little I know?" or how about "I have no idea what I'm doing. I might as well just quit while I'm ahead." All these thoughts are common to know is known as imposture syndrome. Imposture syndrome is when one gets a deep feeling of inadequacy and incompetence when at work, tackling some task or when given a new responsibility. This is usually due to a lack of self-confidence or <>.

So how do we break free from this vicious cycle? How do we squash our negative automatic thoughts (ANTS) when learning a new skill or new a new environment? Well this depends on if I truly don't know what I'm doing, or if I know what to do but I just have a lack of confidence in the moment. This takes discernment and self-reflection.

To help you understand which situation you might be in it's helpful to know about the Dunning-Kruger Effect

In the first case, when I really have no idea what I'm doing, I find the best way for me to step out of denial is to be brutally honest. That is, we need to brave enough to be genuinely authentic and  admit our lack of knowledge and ask a simple question or ask for a brief explanation. For example, I could say: "I'm not sure what you mean by that, could you please clarify?" or, "This is how I understand what you are saying. Is that correct?". It takes a lot of guts and a big piece of humble-pie to be honest with yourself and clearly communicate with others that you don't understand something they expect you to and you pretend that you do. The irony is that once we admit where I am and ask a question, people end up respecting you for it and perceiving you as either honest or attentive and insightful.

In the second case, when one knows what to do but they just have a lack of self-confidence, I suggest to decide in that moment to push those thoughts away and replace them with an action plan.
Ask yourself: "What would someone do in the situation who was confident and knew what there doing?" Once you can answer that, then do it! Don't let your negative thoughts come back and sabotage you again!

There may be times when you are very confident that you are correct, yet you are absolutely wrong. It's important to be aware of this and to admit your mistake when it does happen. This may be in part due to that in the beginning we trivialize a topic and think we understand it completely. However, once we are asked to use this new knowledge to generalize or to create something new, we quickly realize we have no idea what we are doing. This is known as the Dunning-Kruger Effect, and can be seen in the following diagram:

<<Talk a bit more about the Dunning-Kruger Effect>>

Four situations: (I can make a nice table or decision tree about this)
1. I am confident but wrong (this is ignorance.. Can talk about Dunning-Kruger)
2. I am confident and am right ().
3. I am insecure and wrong (A lack of knowledge. willingness to learn is key)
4. I am insecure and correct (Need more confidence)

These are nearly the same things: (but these don't talk about confidence and insecurities, which is how I started writing this post)
1. I think I'm right but I'm actually wrong.
2. I think I'm right and am actually correct.
3. I think I'm wrong and am actually wrong.
4. I think I'm wrong when I'm actually right.

How do we know which ones we are in? How to best respond to each one?

Be the dumbest person in the room.
