<p>Hey everybody.&nbsp; These have to be the most amazing pictures I've ever taken to date!&nbsp; Thanks a ton to the University of Waterloo Photography Club for the setup and making these photos possible.</p>
<p>The 1st two in the series are wet balloons being popped.&nbsp; How awesome is that, eh? </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a  style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mg_0002_edit_resize.jpg" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a  style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mg_0003_edit_resize.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>This next one is a water-balloon the moment after the pop.&nbsp; Seeing the water frozen like this is amazing.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a  style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mg_9984_edit_resize.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>After playing around with the balloons we moved on to bouncing a viscous fluid on a speaker by varying the frequency.&nbsp; It was spectacular.&nbsp; Seriously...</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a  style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mg_0033_edit_resize.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>If you look carefully you can see another camera in the background of the picture.&nbsp; The speaker was surrounded by around 15 photographers cramming in to get a good shot.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a  style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mg_0035_edit2_resize.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>This one is my favourite.&nbsp; I like the angle of the shot.&nbsp; The crispness.&nbsp; The almost perfect spherical blobs.&nbsp; Just a lot of cool things happening at once.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a  style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mg_0041_edit_resize.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>So those were some of the better shots from the UW Photography Club&nbsp; - High Speed Meeting.&nbsp; I hope you will all enjoy looking at them.&nbsp; It was lots of fun taking them.</p>
<p>I don't think I'll be able to top this post for some time.</p>
