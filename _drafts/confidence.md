%% Confidence

2018-08-16

Siti and I went out for lunch with Carolyn MacGregor since we were done TAing SYDE 162 for her. We went to Almadina at the Boardwalk. I asked Carolyn what I could improve on moving forward. She said two things:
1. My confidence.
2. My spelling.

She said she did notice an improvement of confidence over the term, but I think she brings up a valid point. I don't feel confident in what I'm doing most of the time.

So some questions I have:
- What is confidence?
- How does one gain more confidence?
- Whey do I have a lack of confidence?

This relates a bit to my "insecurities" draft post.

A few weeks ago Ahmed and I were out for coffee. He also mentioned that I'm a pretty timid person and that I should be more 'confident'. I'm not sure he used the exact word 'confident', but it was along those lines. That I shouldn't be scared to speak up.

I also read in Derren Brown's book last night that confidence only exists in a relationship to others. I disagree, but even if one is alone, they can have a lack of or an abundance of confidence.

Doubt surely thrives when confidence is not present. Think of my engagement. I was full of doubt and worry. A leader is confident in his / her decisions. So me experiencing so much confusion and double led to a lack of confidence.
