A thriller horror movie is designed to keep the viewer in a constant state on <<uncertainty>>. Will the monster kill? Wil
They are more effective when they don't show you what's off the screen.

We think the most horrible thoughts that could happen to us.
Facing the demons of your imagination. If you can stand that, then you grow up.

If I want to get better I have to find out what I'm avoiding and what I'm afraid of.
I need to face it by voluntarily exposing myself to it, and allow it to change me.
This is not the natural course of life. It has to be intentional.

Be the master of your own fear.
Think of batman. He faced his fears of bats. So epic.

Look! I'm afraid of something and I'm avoiding it! That means a dragon! and treasure.
If your afraid of the thing you haven't developed enough to handle it, and you should be able to handle it.
This is positive discovery. You found out where you have a weakness and can now address it.

Life is fundamental suffering. The world doesn't grow safer, you just grow more competent.
