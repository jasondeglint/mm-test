What is the story I tell myself?

How come it's easy to beat myself up than it is to be confident?

How come it's easier to be full of doubt than it is it to be confident?

How come it's easier to be dissatisfied than it is to be content?

How come we only eat healthy and exercise when we are told we are ill or going to die?
    being diagnosed with cancer.
    how do we raise the bottom? They hit rock bottom.
