Title: Progress over perfection.

Main ideas coming out of my writing:
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- (over) planning as a form of procrastination

Ask:
- How are these main ideas linked to each other?
- Start before you think you are ready, because you'll never be ready until you start (this is the key idea tying them together). You will figure it out as you go, and

Often times I find that I can research and plan a project or task to the point that it takes away from actually accomplishing the task. In essence, I am procrastinating by planning for what I will do but never actually do it. I feel productive, and yet I'm not productive at all. I don't feel ready so I don't start.

Take for example when I start a new coding project. I have to research all the different IDEs and make sure I know every little detail about them before I start. I limit my progress by trying to understand everything at once. I am much better off to start coding in any given IDE, learn what is working and what is not, and then re-adjust my trajectory from there.

The irony is, I don't even know all the problems I will face until I actually just start. On top of that, reading about the problem or trying to understand everything at once is just a waste of time.

Deeper understanding will come with time.

I'm reminded of the lean start-up / agile method where it's better to get something on the table as soon as possible that works okay, opposed to working on the perfect solution for a long period of time and in the end having nothing. In order to converge to something that works, it's better to just start, build something, and then improve.

Or another example is exercising. I am a master procrastinator when it comes to exercising my body. I can waste hours looking at different gyms and reading reviews online. Or planning what types of work-outs I'll do when I eventually get to the gym. Or just having a fear of what people will think of me when they see me at the gym. Surely they will realize I have no idea what I'm doing. Yet, these are just excuses and procrastination in the form of planning. Perhaps you can relate.

We want the beach body now. What we don't realize is that if we start going to the gym on a regular basis the outcome will happen by itself. We need to fall in love with making systems, processes and habits opposed to falling in love with the outcome or the final goal.

Take for example exercise and physical health / fitness. I often complain about being out of shape or having a sore back, yet I don't do anything about it. I don't even make the effort to

Starting is usually the hardest part. We convince ourselves we are not ready. Whatever it may be: not enough time, not enough knowledge, not enough support from friends. In reality, we already have everything we need. I think the old adage is true: it's not about the resources you have, it's about how resourceful you are with what you have.

What am I avoiding doing? What am I procrastinating to do? That is probably what I should be doing.

Do I think I am succeeding while I'm actually failing slowly?

Action does not equal progress. Make sure I'm doing my one thing! Priorities, but that is for another post.

Progress over perfection.

Perfect is the enemy of good. Initially you will sacrifice quality, but in the long run the quality will be much higher than if you just planned and executed one design.

Initially you will sacrifice quality, which can be devastating for a perfectionist. But in the long term it will pay off and the quality of the final outcome will be much higher than if you kept planning and researching .

The irony is that by initially sacrificing quality the final result will be of higher quality compared to if you started by researching (and not actually working) and then iterating fewer times. Refine your work, whether that be and idea, an article, computer code, a drawing, a piece of music or your posture when lifting weights. Get your first version out so you can get a baseline and then improve. Don't be scared of initially creating something mediocre. Realistically your first go at it will be sub-optimal. But the key is to not stop there. Keep producing and the quality will increase over time.

So here is what I want you to do; This is my plan of action as well:

Stop overthinking. Stop overanalyzing.

Just start. Just do it.

See where you're at. Learn from your successes and mistakes.

Repeat.

Remember: the goal is progress, not perfection.

How come when I have all the resources I need to get the job done, I don't do the job.
For example, I have a full scholarship do complete a PhD, a supportive wife who makes my lunch. Academic supervisors that allows the freedom to explore what I like. An education that gave  me a solid foundation.
Yet, when I have all this, and I need to get a job done (e.g. collect data and code up a neural network) I avoid it and don't get started.
I seem to find ways to fill my time and justify doing other necessary, less important tasks such as checking and answering emails or researching tools that would help me get the job done.
Or I might find meetings to go to that I probably don't need to be at. Or I get sucked into some conspiracy theory and dedicate hours of my time to learn about why the earth is actually flat (it's not) or why people claim aliens are all around us, yet we don't have any solid evidence for them (Don't think about it too long otherwise you'll get sucked in too).
This is procrastination in it's finest form. Self-sabotage reigning my life.
And at the end of the day I just wonder 'why?'.

So this 'why' leads me to deeply think about why I do what I do and makes me think I need to come to terms with knowing why I procrastinate.

Perhaps I procrastinate because I'm afraid of failing, or maybe even afraid of succeeding.
Perhaps I procrastinate because I'm lazy and I've grown soft being in academia too long where I don't report to a boss who could fire me if I don't do my job.
Perhaps I procrastinate because I just don't know where to start.

But these are all lies.

The reality is that I don't need to know why I procrastinate. In fact, me trying to figure out why I procrastinate is another form of procrastination! The irony! Procrastination inception!
The reality is that these tasks won't get done unless I do them.
The reality is that I am really shooting myself in the foot by pushing off the most important tasks and replacing them with menial insignificant tasks.
The reality is that I am actually in denial about what is going on.
The reality is that I am deceiving myself.

Now I don't know why I am so good and self-deception and self-sabotage, but the reality is that I am.
I don't need to know why in order to actually get work done.
