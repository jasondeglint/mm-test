When we make income from our employer there are automatic deductions from our paycheck such as income tax, CPP and EI.
Essentially they withhold the money from, which is called a withholding tax.
This amount gets reported on your T4 statement


# Getting money out of an RRSP

How do I get money out of a RRSP?
I either withdraw and pay a tax penalty, or I start an Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF).
When you withdraw the bank withholds a certain percentage which they send to the CRA on your behalf. They legally need to do this.

## Option 1: Withdraw Funds directly from RRSP
There are significant penalties for withdrawing from an RRSP

"
When you withdraw funds from an RRSP, *your financial institution withholds the tax*. The rates depend on your residency and the amount you withdraw. For residents of Canada, the rates are:
10% (5% in Quebec) on amounts up to $5,000
20% (10% in Quebec) on amounts over $5,000 up to including $15,000
30% (15% in Quebec) on amounts over $15,000
