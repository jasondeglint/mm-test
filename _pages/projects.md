## Alsaasdfgae Identification Using Machine Learning
<img style="float: left; padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" src="/assets/degli1.png" height="50%" width="50%">

Water brings life, and everyone deserves to know if their water is clean and safe to drink. As seen in Lake Erie from the MODIS sensor, harmful algae blooms (HABs) can grow out of control in our waters and produce lethal toxins which negatively affect our livelihood and the environment. For my PhD thesis I am exploring combining multi-spectral imaging with machine learning to automatically identify and count different types of algae in a water sample. I am constructing a custom microscope in order to collect data and then using deep learning methods to provide valuable insights into this data. [Blue Lion Labs Ltd.](http://bluelionlabs.ml/) is the spin off company that is exploring commercialization of this technology.

## Artery Tracking from Ultrasound Videos

Blood is the life that runs through our veins and arteries via the heart. Determining the cardiovascular health of a patient is often assessed by imaging the arteries with a ultrasound probe.
During my masters, my colleagues and I created MAUI (Measurements from Arterial Ultrasound Imaging), a software tool for cardiovascular researches to process artery data efficiently and reliably.
MAUI is able to automatically detect and track artery walls captured with an ultrasound machine and is now commercially available from [Hedgehog Medical Inc.](http://hedgehogmedical.com/)
