Currently I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo where I function as a member of the [Vision and Image Processing (VIP) group](https://uwaterloo.ca/vision-image-processing-lab/) under the supervision of [Dr. Alexander Wong](http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~a28wong/). My research interests primarily include deep learning computational microscopy and natural language processing. I have a strong interest in business and entrepreneurship so that I can solve big problems and turn great ideas into value. I see this as only the beginning and I am looking forward to new experiences where I can continue to be challenged and grow as an individual.

In 2014 I received my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering with Distinction from the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/) in BC, Canada. During my undergraduate studies I worked at a variety of different companies as a co-op. First, from January to April 2011 and September to December 2011 I worked at [Research In Motion (BlackBerry)](https://www.blackberry.com/ca/en). Then from May to July 2012 I worked at [National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR)](https://www.nlr.org/) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Finally, from January to August 2013 I worked at [MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA)](https://mdacorporation.com/).

In 2016 I completed my Masters of Applied Science in Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo. During my M.A.Sc. I worked at [Christie Digital Systems Inc.](https://www.christiedigital.com/en-us) from September 2014 to April 2015. During my Masters research I founded [Hedgehog Medical Inc.](http://hedgehogmedical.com/) (2016), which provides software to find and track artery walls from ultrasound images and videos. For my PhD I am currently working on using machine learning for algae identification and have founded [Blue Lions Labs Ltd.](http://bluelionlabs.ml/) (2018) to explore commercialization of this technology.

My awards include the Co-op Student of the Year Award (2012), the Talbot Memorial Fund Award (2013) and the Andreas Antoniou Medal for Digital Signal Processing (2015) all from the University of Victoria (UVic). I also received the Distinguished Paper Award from the Society of Information Display (SID) (2015) and the Best Paper Award for the Conference of Computer Vision and Imaging Systems (CVIS) (2015).
I was also awarded the Sandford Fleming Foundation Teaching Assistant Award (2016) from the University of Waterloo.
Finally, I was awarded the AquaHacking Challenge first place prize (2017) as well as the Future Engineers for Water and Environmental Safety (FEWES) International Student Competition second place prize (2018).
