I am still studying Electrical Engineering at UVic on Vancouver Island and just started my final co-op / internship position at [MDA](http://www.mdacorporation.com/corporate/index.cfm).  I will be working here full time for 8 months as a computer programmer and then going back to UVic for my final semesters to complete my degree. :)  I am very excited to have this opportunity to work at MDA.   MDA's big claim to fame is that they build the [Canada Arm](http://is.mdacorporation.com/mdais_canada/Programs/Programs_SRMS.aspx) on the [International Space Station(ISS)](http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/iss/default.asp)!! Awesome eh?

So on the topic of the ISS and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), I'm sure most of you know that Canadian Astronaut [Chris Hadfield]("http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/missions/expedition34-35/default.asp) is the current Commander on the ISS.  And... since MDA does many space related projects I started to investigate if there were any connections between Chris Hadfield and MDA.  It only took a few days of keeping my eyes open and I found a signed photograph of Commander Hadfield on the wall!!  I asked the nearest receptionist if I could take a picture of the signed photograph and she told me that she was able to get me a copy of the photo!  Man was that amazing news! :)

For all your twitter fans, [Commander Chris Hadfield](https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield) has a twitter account where he posts breath-taking photos taken from space on his Nikon DSLR.

So I hope you enjoyed this post.  I still have lots of pictures from my recent travels to the Netherlands and plan to start editing and posting more of them in the near future.
