This past week I gave two talks presenting my research about [building a system to automatically identify algae](http://www.jasondeglint.com/projects/).
The first talk was at the [25th Latornell Conservation Symposium](http://www.latornell.ca/) in Alliston, Ontario which "explores the status of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River and the lands that connect them in order to assess the work currently underway to protect, conserve and enhance them".

The second talk was at the [American Water Works Association (AWWA) Water Quality Technology Conference (WQTC)](https://www.awwa.org/conferences-education/conferences/water-quality-technology.aspx) in Toronto, Ontario. WQTC was a fascinating conference that let me better understand what tools are being developed to understand algae blooms behaviours. I spent the majority of my week at WQTC in Toronto. My AirBnB was downtown Toronto right near the CN Tower.

Here is shot of the view the apartment. This picture (and all the others) is brought to you by the Pixel 3 camera.

[Idexx](https://ca.idexx.com/en-ca/), a US based international company that develops water testing equipment (among other things as well), generously hosted a dinner at [Ripley's Aquarium](https://www.ripleyaquariums.com/canada/)!
In the first image you can see a number of anemones and in the second a shark. Very beautiful!

I met tons of great researchers and industry experts at WQTC and very much hope to go again next year.
I even met some of the authors of papers that I have been reading for my PhD.
Here is a shot of a group of us going for dinner.
