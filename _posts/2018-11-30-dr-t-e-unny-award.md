This past week I had the honour of receiving the [Dr. T.E. Unny Memorial Award](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/awards/dr-te-unny-memorial-award).
The late Dr. T.E. Unny was a professor in Civil Engineering and Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo from 1965 until 1991.
This award was given right before the [Miroslaw Romanowski Lecture, which was hosted by the Water Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-YzPEA6EhY). At this lecture [Dr. Keith Hipel](http://www.systems.uwaterloo.ca/Faculty/Hipel/) was awarded the Miroslaw Romanowski Medal and delivered his presentation titled "Negotiations over Groundwater Contamination".

Dr. Hipel (left) was a student of Dr. Unny (right) and they can be seen together in the following photo.

This next photo shows all the recipients of the award as well as those who handed out the awards.
The purpose of this award is to provide financial support for graduate students in the Faculty of Engineering who are working in the field of stochastic and statistical methods in hydrology and environmental engineering.

I'm very grateful to receive this award in honour of Dr. T.E. Unny and inspired by his life. From what I learned from [Dr. Ponnambalam](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/profile/ponnu), he was a very thoughtful and compassionate individual who was full of new ideas.
