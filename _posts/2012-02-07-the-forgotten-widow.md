Today while I was studying for my Electronic Circuits midterm I was listening to classical music while working at the library (sounds nerdy I know...)  And as fun as studying transformers, rectifiers, diodes, and other non-linear circuit elements can be, I was suddenly distracted by a melody that popped in my head.  It must have been triggered by the music as well as the material I was studying.

The only problem was that I couldn't remember who the composer was or what the piece was called.  I only recalled that I used to listen to this piece way back in my first year of school.  I must say that it didn't matter how important my exam was tomorrow, I had to find this piece of music.

So after about a 25 minute hunt I finally determined the piece of music.  I had remember that it was written for a play containing some very interesting characters.  The piece was "Ase's Death by Edvard Grieg" which is a selection from the story of Peer Gynt.  In the play Ase is a widow who ends up dying.  It is very sad and the music reflects this.

The music itself is so incredibly moving.  While listening to the music it actually made me stop in my tracks. I had to just listen.  It's wierd but I think the music even made me feel some physical pain.  One would think music couldn't do this.

I think my favourite part of the piece might be at 1:39.  Right when you think the music can't build any more it keeps building.  It's great.  I also like, how at the end, the music slowly dies off; like Ase is trying her best to hang on to life.
It also makes me think of the words of T.S. Eliot (You can thank my Dr. Who influence to know about this ;) ).

"This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper."

So sorry to get all emotional on you, but I wanted to share some music appreciation.  Also, the title of this post probably sounds a lot more dramatic than it actually is.  But in the play Ase is the widow, and she was forgotten by me.  And I was very pleased to be able to find the piece of music back.

I encourage you to just stop and listen.  Maybe you won't care at all, maybe it will make you cry.  Who knows...  Let me know what you think.  I most definitely can't take the credit.  I'm just passing it on.

I hope you enjoy. :)
