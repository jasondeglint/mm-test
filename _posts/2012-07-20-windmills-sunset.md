These next set of pictures I find absolutely wonderful. The sunset was actually this awesome! For real! I’ve driven by these windmills for work 6 times now and I finally got to photograph them. I’m so glad the way these pictures turned out.

I also find the clouds very impressive. Since the Netherlands is so flat you can see the clouds a long way off. It is very beautiful the way the rolling clouds cover the sky.

The GPS coordinates are 52.592204, 5.575390 if you would like to look them up.  You can also see the scale of the windmills in this next picture.  If you look carefully you can see two people walking along the path.

The interesting part about this area of land is that the Dutch claimed it from the sea in 1932 by building the Afsluitdijk.

The complements exchanged between man-made structures and nature.  It's great.

That's it for now.  Thanks for taking a look. :)
