Two weekends ago I went to Paris with some of my Dutch family! We woke up very early for a 6 hour drive, were in Paris for about 7 hours and then drove home again. So this is Paris in a day:

The first stop we made was the Notre Dame. It was very beautiful. Lots of tourists.

Next we went to the Eiffel Tower and it started pouring rain! It was quite fun.

Next we went to the Arc de Triumph. This was by far the highlight of the trip. The view from up top is amazing. Also, it was a perfect day for taking pictures. Slightly overcast but still able to see far. The light was very nice and soft.

To get to the top of the Arc de Triumph we had to climb up a number of spiral stairs.

I really like this next picture. It was taken while we were driving in the car. This boy started looking at me so I took a picture of him.

Here’s a black and white photo from the Paris Metro system. I was very impressed how deep and how integrate it is. It’s an intense maze of tunnels.
