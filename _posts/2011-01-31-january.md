So welcome to my 1st blog post. This is pretty cool. I've never had a blog before.

Recent circumstances in my life have allowed met to pursue my interest in photography. My goal is to be an active photographer and take interesting, captivating pictures. I do not yet have a DSLR but only a point and shoot. Hopefully that will change soon.

This post may be on the longer side since I want to cover my highlights of January...

This past weekend I visited my sister in Hamilton, Onatario. We took a day trip out to the Niagara Region. Here is part of the Niagara Falls.

This is my cool sister that I mentioned earlier.

After the falls we went to Niagara on the Lake. This is a picture of Fort Niagara located across the river in the States.

At one point we were in a small restaurant. I found this rustic broom while walking down the stairs. I liked the picture so much I made it my header.

Walking around Niagara on the Lake. We had a really good time.

This is the local cemetery in Niagara on the Lake. There is a feeling I get when I am in cemeteries which is hard for me to describe. Mesmerized, captivated, peaceful, depth. I'm not totally sure on the proper word yet. Hopefully the picture does a better job of expressing the atmosphere than I do.

Okay... so this is cool. Here are a couple of macro shots. I am taking part in a photo a week project to help improve my photography. Every week there a theme that you must complete. I'm not a huge salad eater but I must say that this was quite the amazing salad.

A card fan with my jugging balls in the background. Two of my hobbies.

A different angle on the same fan. I like how the details in the papyrus are visible.

This was taken out window at my work. It was incredible! I've never seen a sunset quite like this one. I call it a candle-flame sunset.

This was taken at McMaster University. I was in my macro mindset wandering around campus and found this picture within the vine. I wonder what story has placed it here.

My very 1st night in Hamilton my sister took me to Hamilton Harbor where we went walking and out for a coffee. Most of the water was frozen.

So... These were some of my highlights and better photos from the month of January. I plan on continuing to take lots of pictures and share some of the more interesting ones here.

Wow... this feels like a large post.

See you all later.
