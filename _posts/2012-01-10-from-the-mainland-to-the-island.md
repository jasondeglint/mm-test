This next set of photos is from the ferry ride from Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay while I was moving back to the Island to continue my studies.  These pictures are a great success for me because they were all taken in manual mode! :)

I always get a kick out of people watching.  It’s also great taking pictures of random people without them knowing it. :P

A little light-house on a small island complementing a forest of trees and the ocean salt-water.

You can see 3 different things in this picture: Henry my buddy (hi Henry), his and my reflection with the background, and finally the picture frames from inside of the boat.  I think this is pretty neat if you ask me. :)

Sometime when I review my pictures I am impressed at some of the results I get.  I must say, these next two pictures turned out much better than I had anticipated.  I like how the sea-gull is flying over the water while the light beams are just cracking through the clouds with the silhouette of the layered islands on the horizon.  What do you think?

And for my final picture I had to go to my fastest shutter speed, highest f-number, and lowest ISO value.  This is why it is called Beautiful British Columbia.

Thanks for sticking around to look at my photos and read my writing.
