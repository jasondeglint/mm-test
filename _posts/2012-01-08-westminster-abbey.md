Upon arriving back in BC I had a surprise visit from some friends from Calgary and so we decided to go for a mid-day excursion to the Westminster Abbey in Mission BC, Canada.

It was truly beautiful there.  The crisp BC air mixed with the green hillsides; it’s days like these that I realize how awesome BC really is.  We went inside for a bit but spent most of our time walking around the Abbey grounds.

I played around a bit with the manual settings of the camera.  I must say that the percentage of good pictures is very low. :P

If you are ever in the Mission area in the Fraser Valley I highly encourage you to go check out the Westminster Abbey.  It is both serene and scenic.
