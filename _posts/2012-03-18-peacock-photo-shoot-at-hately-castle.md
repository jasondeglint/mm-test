So it’s been some time since I actually posted some photos on my blog. I didn’t hear any complaints so I figure it wasn’t that big of a deal. ;-) I’ve been super busy with school and life lately, but over the last couple of weeks I have been trying to relax a bit more and take time to do more things I enjoy, photography being one of them.

Today I went to the Hatley Castle at Royal Roads University. It was very beautiful there which made photography quite enjoyable. The ironic part is that I didn’t even get any good shots of the castle itself and to my surprise many pictures of peacocks. :P So this is just a peacock photo-shoot more than anything else, but that’s fine because the peacock is a very colourful animal.

So the first four images are from the grounds of the Hately Castle.
Statue in the garden:

The lazy lion protecting the castle grounds:

And... looking down:

Now for all the wonderful peacock pictures I was talking about. The 1st one is my personal favourite.

I named this next peacock “the urban peacock” due to its choice of grazing grounds.

At first when I started photographing “the urban peacock” it was very weary of my presence and kept a safe distance. However, after spending 15 minutes with it while taking pictures I suppose it grew rather found of me (or of being famous), because, when I decided to move on I found that it was following me! I wasn’t sure if I made a new friend or a pet. Oh well... he/she probably forgot me by now.

The final two pictures are of another peacock in a tree.

That’s all for now. Thanks for taking a look and I hope you enjoyed the pictures.
