As part of my PhD I attended the [PhycoTech Workshop](https://www.phycotech.com/Workshop), a week long workshop (July 9-13) in St. Joseph, Michigan, USA.
During this workshop I met amazing researchers from all around North America and learned how to identity different types of algae.
Throughout the week I deepened my understanding of microscopy, imaging technologies, algae ecology and microbiology.

During our free time in the evenings I also got to enjoy the sandy beaches of Lake Michigan, sate parks, as well as the local restaurants.

One of the most amazing things I saw on my trip were seeing fireflies (bioluminescent beetles) for the first time. I wasn't able to capture any of these on my camera so I found this [image on the web](http://backyardsfornature.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/firefly-by-jessica-lucia-creative-commons-license-firefly-in-hand.jpg).
