So yesterday I arrived in Amsterdam from Vancouver, and I am now in the Netherlands for my internship at [NLR](http://www.nlr.nl/)!  I start my internship tomorrow and my job will be to work on the EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) and the EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) of quadrocopters. Quadrocoptures are super cool. You should [watch this video from youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5SSkkBgAvQ&amp;feature=player_embedded).

Today my flat-mate and I rode our bikes to my work so I know how to get there tomorrow morning. Thanks to my flat-mate for helping me find my work as well as taking this picture.

You can see that it’s an older looking building which is neat. You can also see my omafiets, which means grandma-bike. It’s not the bike that my grandma used to ride... but the brand name called of omafiets. Very masculine eh? ;)

The plan is that I go exploring / touring around downtown Amsterdam with my cousin this Saturday. I plan to try to take some pictures so hopefully I get some good / interesting ones that I can share on this blog. :)
